I plan on developing this game and having basic functionality out by 14.09.2025.
It is a simple card game in which you play as the human, can pick up items, and use them to kill enemies.
Mechanics will be explained in this README later once I add them.
Play it through the webpage link assigned to this repo.
Its meant for phone screens because on a normal desktop 1080p all of the cards end up being too tall for it.
